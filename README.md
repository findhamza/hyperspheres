Graphically sampling of hyperspheres

Numerical Methods
Programming Assignment 3

We have discussed approaches to sampling hyperspheres.  The general equation is as follows:

r ← [0,1] ; θ ← [0,2π] ; x = droot(r*cos(θ)) ; y = droot(r*sin(θ))

Where r is the unit radius,  is the angle in radians and d is the dimensionality of the hypersphere.

In addition, we discussed Archimedes’ theorem, that the area of a sphere equals the area of every right circular cylinder circumscribed about the sphere (excluding the bases). The axial projection of any measurable region on a sphere on the right circular cylinder circumscribed about the sphere preserves area.

    • Your first task is to write a professionally documented functioning program that allows the user to input ranges for r and  and produce a two-dimensional image sampling of a circle segment.  By testing a variety of user inputs, provide a summary description of the ways in which the user input affects the graphical output.
    • Your second task is to extend the concept to three dimensions (adding) and again, allow for different values of r, .  Describe in summary what affect different values of the variables has on the output.
